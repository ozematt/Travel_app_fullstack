# Travel

Welcome to my project **Travel**! ðŸŽ’âœ¨ The project was created based on a free layout from Figma: [Travel UI Kit](https://www.figma.com/community/file/993910904620677970). The goal of this project was to practice working with **TailwindCSS** as well as integrating with modern frontend and backend tools.

## Features

- **Responsiveness**: The app adjusts to different screen sizes (mobile-first design).
- **Theme Switcher**: The ability to switch between light and dark themes.
- **User Management**: Adding and storing users in the database.
- **Form Validation**: Forms are created using **React Hook Form** and validated with **Zod**.
- **State Management**: **Context API** is used for global state management in the app.
